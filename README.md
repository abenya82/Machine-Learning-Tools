# Deep Learning Techniques

This is a small repository of deep learning methods.  
I wanted to make this repository as a documentation of my work in graduate school.
Deep Learning is a fantasitcally fun subject to study.  It's truly magic and elegance.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** Python, Pytorch

Python is popular among deep learning coders.  I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn deep learning methods to use a easy-for-humans to read language.

Jupyter Notebooks are brilliant for prototyping code.  I enjoy the flexability and transparentness of working in a notebook before implementing the code into a proper framework.


## Optimizations

*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.

## Examples
