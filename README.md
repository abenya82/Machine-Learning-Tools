# Deep Learning Techniques

This is a small repository of deep learning methods.  
I wanted to make this repository as a documentation of my work in graduate school.
Deep Learning is a fantasitcally fun subject to study.  It's truly magic (but mostly statistics).

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** Python, Pytorch

Python is popular among deep learning coders.  I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn deep learning methods to use a easy-for-humans to read language.

Jupyter Notebooks are brilliant for prototyping code.  I enjoy the flexability and transparentness of working in a notebook before implementing the code into a proper framework.


## Optimizations



## Lessons Learned

Load weights of trained models if possible.  Unless the model is truly unique, models do not need to be re-trained on local machines.  Load checkpoints or download pre-trained models whenever possible.

## Examples

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
